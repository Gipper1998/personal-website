                        <p>
                            Thank you for visiting my website. I'm Trent, a senior at Florida Polytechnic Engineering
                            student studying Computer Engineering.
                            Previously, I transferred from the Florida Institute of Technology as a Resident Assistant
                            and graduated from the College of the Florida Keys with an Associate of Arts degree.
                            I have obtained many goals thus far and am continuously pursuing new ones that are bigger,
                            bolder, and more impractical.
                            While studying Computer Engineering, I developed a background in back-end and front-end
                            coding, with additional robotics-related projects, and I developed a rover that can move
                            autonomously with the support of the Florida Space Institute Capstone team at Florida Poly.
                            Please see all my fantastic work, previous experience, and social links below. If you have
                            any questions or need clarity, please get in touch with me.

                                Learning about robotics and the different types of path planning algorithms have always intrigued
                                me in the direction of where robotics is heading in the future. My background with robotics features
                                being able to run Servo and DC Motors connected to an Arduino Uno to operate. In addition, a Raspberry Pi 
                                would be used for communicating to the Arduino to direct which path the robot should move in terms of it's
                                current surrounding.

                                Back in my hometown in the Florida Keys, I volunteered for a small organization called
                                Grimal Grove, a non-for profit that helped revitalizing a plot of land to host rare and exotic
                                fruit trees. It's been a long time since I was last able to see the progress of such a wonderful
                                project to be apart of, but I know it'll do well for educating future generations to learn
                                about our wonderful environment, and some fruit trees on the side.

                                Florida Polycon is a convention-style event located at Florida Polytechnic University. My part in running
                                one of the largest events at Florida Poly as Vice President of Vendors is coordinating with vendors located within Central Florida 
                                and across the U.S. in negotiations for rendering services and leading our exhibitor shopping area. There was a lot of communicating between exhibitors/vendors,
                                multiple departments of not only Polycon, but the University as a whole.

                                development of the person I wanted to be, mindful, resourceful, and creative. Throughout my time as an RA, my task was to make 
                                educational events for all residents relating to campus resources and best tips of how to survive college, in addition to monitoring the residence hall.
                                During my time, I was awarded with the Silent Performer of the year for contributing many ideas and assisting residents without needing to ask.

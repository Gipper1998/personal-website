                        Hello, my name is Trent Halama and I am currently in 
                        my senior year at Florida Polytechnic University seeking
                        a Bachelors Degree in Computer Engineering. Originally grew
                        up in the Florida Keys and previously attended Florida Institute
                        of Technology and College of the Florida Keys.

                        Throughout my journey outside academics, I have been on lots of adventures outside academics
                        like being a Resident Assistant, and currently an Orientation Leader and serving on
                        the Florida Polycon board as Vice-President of Vendors.

                        In my studies I have done projects ranging with communicating with Arduino
                        using registers, autonomous robotic vechicles, and a wide range of coding
                        projects. I am continuing to learn every day and I continue to make progress
                        on achieving all my goals and making new ones every single day.

                        in with a group to build a robot that can navigate a terrain and decide
                        which path to take. This project had the following materials needed to replicate

                            I started in 2022 as the Vendor-Events Coordinator, communicating with all vendors such as Fireworks, Food Trucks, and so much more.
                            Now I serve as the Vice President of Vendors for 2023, which directs all vendors in the exhibitor space to conclude my senior year at the University.

                             While learning some network terminology, I helped develop a website for the company (www.nettally.com) and helped with customer relations.

                            In the Fall of 2023, I became an Orientation Leader for the University under the New Student and Family Program at Florida Polytechnic University. 
                            During this process, I helped the newly incoming class of 2027 transition from the High School to the University lifestyle by letting them know the resources available if they need any assistance. 
                            In addition, answering any questions they have as well as touch base with them throughout their first semester at the University.

                            I served as a role model throughout the dorms answering any questions, maintaining policies, and running small events to bring awareness of various topics such as diversity and campus resources. 
                            I also was a part of helping transition the first years from High School to the University lifestyle.

                            It was a chance to volunteer, give back to my local community, and help preserve this iconic landscape in the Florida Keys.

                            Thank you for visiting my website! I'm Trent, a Graduate from Florida Polytechnic University  
                            earning a Bachelors of Science in Computer Engineering with ABET accreditation.
                            Previously, I transferred from the Florida Institute of Technology as a Resident Assistant,
                            and Graduated from the College of the Florida Keys with an Associate of Arts degree.
                            Throughout my studies and during my off time, I have been involved in experimenting with Embedded
                            and Software Engineering projects and leadership roles within and outside of Academics.
                            I am open to new opportunities that will be mutually beneficial, contributing to your organization's
                            success while advancing my career. To learn more, scroll down to see my experience and my contact page, 
                            where you can reach out and discuss how we can collaborate. Or if you want to see my coding first hand,
                            try out some of the games below that helped me in learning how to program first hand.

                                from the top of a lunar crater to the bottom. This will be done using a RASSOR rover by adding a flywheel based digging tool
                                that can be mounted to perform the operation at a fifteen degree angle. Throughout the project there was autonomous system being developed,
                                the flywheel contraception, and developing the circuit model for moving around the terrain using LiDAR sensors and DC motors. The RASSOR pictured
                                was provided by the Florida Space Institute (FSI) whom works in conjunction with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

                                As an Orientation Leader, the important task was to not only to make the incoming student's life a lot easier, but
                                guide them in how Florida Polytechnic University functions. Talking about the do's and don'ts, best places to take 
                                a break, and where to get involved on campus throughout their 4 years.

                                Representative of the Student Government Association for all Engineers at Florida Polytechnic University. My main position
                                was to not only expand Engineering opportunities, but also to listen to student's in how the University not only functions, but 
                                make it a better experience for them as a whole. That is one of the main reasons why I decided to be Vice Chair of the Advocacy
                                and Communications Committee in SGA, to represent students on their behalf to voice their concerns.

                                Before transferring from Florida Tech to Florida Poly, being a Resident Assistant (RA) helped bring my leadership skills and
                                development of the person I wanted to be, mindful, resourceful, and creative. Throughout my time as an RA, my task was to make 
                                educational events for all residents relating to campus resources and best tips of how to survive college, in addition to monitoring the residence hall.
                                During my time, I was awarded with the Silent Performer of the year for contributing many ideas and assisting residents without needing to ask.

                                Back in the Florida Keys (my hometown), I volunteered for a small organization called
                                Grimal Grove, a non-for profit that helped revitalizing a plot of land to host rare and exotic
                                fruit trees. It's been a long time since I was last able to see the progress of such a wonderful
                                project to be apart of, but I know it'll do well for educating future generations to learn
                                about our wonderful environment, and some fruit trees on the side.
